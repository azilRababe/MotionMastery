    "description":"The exercise ball roll-out is an exercise that strengthens the core, shoulders and upper- back muscles. It starts in a plank-style position, with the arms resting on a ball. Then, you roll the ball out in front of you as far as you can while maintaining a strong, neutral spinal position. The lack of stability from the ball increases the degree of difficulty. This is a difficult movement, and beginners may need to use a limited range of motion.",

    "title":"Piriformis SMR",
    "description":"Piriformis self-myofascial release (SMR) is a self-administered soft-tissue treatment for the lower body, usually using a foam roller, lacrosse ball, or other \"trigger point\" massage tool. By applying pressure strategically to the piriformis muscles in the upper gluteal region, some people find they can cause this often painful and tight muscle to relax or \"release.\" Piriformis SMR is often accompanied by SMR on the iliotibial (IT) band or tensor fascia lata (TFL muscles), or by stretches that target the glutes and hips.",

    "description":"The band-assisted chin-up is a variation of the pull-up exercise in which the reps are performed with the palms facing toward the body in an underhand position, with a band looped around the feet or knees. This reduces weight and resistance at the bottom of the rep, while increasing it toward the top. Like other pull-up variations, it builds strength and muscle in the upper back, biceps, and core, but it utilizes the biceps slightly more than overhand band-assisted pull-ups.",

    "description":"The dumbbell stiff-legged deadlift is a dumbbell exercise that targets the hamstrings, glutes, lower and upper back, and core. The difference between a stiff-legged deadlift and a Romanian deadlift is primarily the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Stiff-legged deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. Feel free to wear a weight belt to protect your lower back.",

Single-leg deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight.

    "title":"Dumbbell split squat",
    "description":"The dumbbell split squat is a popular lower-body exercise to build strength and muscle one leg at a time. It can be used to teach proper lunge form, but is also valuable on its own when trained in traditional strength-focused rep ranges, such as 5-8 reps per set, or for higher reps to build muscle or for conditioning.",

    "description":"The dumbbell deadlift is a movement that targets the hamstrings, glutes, and back muscles. While it can be performed all the way from the ground, in the style of a barbell deadlift, it is more often performed from the top down as a Romanian deadlift. The dumbbell deadlift can be performed in low rep ranges to build posterior strength, or for moderate to high reps to build muscle and endurance.",

    "description":"The single-arm stiff-legged deadlift is a dumbbell exercise that targets the hamstrings, glutes, lower and upper back, and core. The difference between a stiff-legged deadlift and a Romanian deadlift is primarily the amount of knee bend. The knees are only slightly bent in a stiff-legged deadlift, while they bend more in a Romanian deadlift. Stiff-legged deadlifts are generally performed for low to moderate reps, such as 8-10 reps per set, with a focus on maximizing the hamstring stretch rather than moving heavy weight. Feel free to wear a weight belt to protect your lower back.",

It is biomechanically different from a barbell deadlift in that it lines up with a lifter's center of gravity, rather than placing the weight in front of their body. It activates all of the same muscle groups as conventional or sumo deadlifts, including the glutes, quads, hamstrings, lower back, lats, upper back, and grip.",

    "description":"The linear jammer is an explosive pressing movement performed using an angled barbell anchored at floor level in a landmine device. It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The linear jammer involves pressing the weight into the air, then catching it with the other hand. The movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges, for lower reps with a focus on explosive pressing power, or for higher reps.",

    "description":"The dumbbell row to triceps kick-back is a dumbbell complex that combines two movements that collectively target the muscles of the lats (latissimus dorsi), upper back, and triceps. It also isometrically targets the core, hamstrings, and glutes. It is usually performed one rep of each movement at a time, although you could perform more reps of each, or increase the reps in successive rounds (e.g., 1 rep in round 1, 2 reps in round 2, etc.). No matter how you structure the sets and reps, it is a time-efficient way to hit two crucial upper-body muscles in any workout.",
