It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.",

Stationary bikes come in multiple variations, ranging from ones that resemble riding a bike, to recumbent bikes, to fan bikes that work both the arms and the legs. No matter the variation, a stationary bike can work well at higher speeds for interval-style conditioning training, but also works well at slower paces for steady-state cardio.",

    "description": "The step-up with knee raise is a lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. It differs from a traditional step-up in that at the top, you lift the trailing leg up to full hip flexion. This gives the exercise a greater range of motion and more of a focus on powerful hip extension in the working leg. When performed with body weight, these are usually performed for high reps as part of a dynamic warm-up, as cardio acceleration, or as part of the lower-body portion of a workout or circuit.",
