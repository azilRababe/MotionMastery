    "gif_url": "https://fitnessprogramer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Burpee-with-Push-Up.gif",
    "overview": "The burpee with push-up is a high-intensity, full-body exercise that combines a traditional burpee with a push-up at the bottom of the movement. This variation not only challenges cardiovascular endurance but also develops upper-body and core strength. It is a staple in conditioning workouts, HIIT sessions, and military-inspired training programs.",
    "steps": [
      "Starting Position: Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides.",
      "Squat Down: Lower into a squat and place your hands flat on the ground in front of you.",
      "Kick Back: Jump your feet backward into a high plank position, keeping your body in a straight line.",
      "Push-Up: Perform a controlled push-up, lowering your chest toward the ground and pressing back up.",
      "Return: Jump your feet forward back into the squat position.",
      "Explosive Jump: Drive upward into a vertical jump, reaching overhead.",
      "Repeat for the desired number of reps or time."

      {
        "question": "Is the burpee with push-up good for fat loss?",
        "answer": "Yes. It is a calorie-intensive, full-body movement that elevates heart rate and burns fat effectively."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can beginners do burpees with push-ups?",
        "answer": "Beginners should first master the basic burpee and push-up separately before combining them."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many burpees with push-ups should I do?",
        "answer": "Start with 3–4 sets of 5–10 reps and progress to timed intervals (20–40 seconds) for conditioning."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many calories does a burpee with push-up burn?",
        "answer": "Depending on intensity and fitness level, it can burn approximately 10–15 calories per minute."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do burpees build muscle?",
        "answer": "While burpees primarily improve conditioning, the push-up component provides upper-body muscle endurance. For hypertrophy, pair them with strength training."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe for people with joint issues?",
        "answer": "Those with knee, shoulder, or lower back pain should modify the movement (e.g., no jump, incline push-up) or avoid until cleared by a professional."

    "overview": "The Step-Behind Rotational Med Ball Throw is an advanced power development drill used in rotational sports like baseball, golf, MMA, and tennis. This is a dynamic, high-velocity rotational throw where the athlete steps behind with one foot and rapidly rotates to toss a medicine ball against a wall or into open space. The movement mimics sport-specific actions like a swing, punch, or shot. It develops explosive rotational strength, hip-to-core transfer, and neuromuscular coordination.",
    "steps": [
      "Start Side-On to a solid wall or open space, holding a light medicine ball (2–6 kg).",
      "Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart and the ball held at waist height.",
      "Step your rear foot behind and across your front foot (like a crossover step).",
      "As your rear foot lands, rotate your hips toward the wall and transfer your weight forward.",
      "Explosively rotate your torso and shoulders, releasing the ball in a side-throw motion.",

    "overview": "The clean and jerk is one of the two main lifts in Olympic weightlifting competitions. It is a highly technical, full-body exercise that trains explosive power , coordination, balance , and strength. The lift consists of two phases: the clean, where the barbell is lifted from the ground to the shoulders, and the jerk, where it is driven overhead. The clean recruits the posterior chain for a powerful pull and hip extension, while the jerk emphasizes upper-body strength and speed for the overhead drive. Mastering this movement requires mobility, timing, and progressive training.",
